    "text": "I choose the ARIMA model for forecasting economic indicators because it’s useful for forecasting a series where the data points are independent of the seasonal components, which is the case with the economic indicators such as CPI, GDP, USD index, unemployment rate, and mortgage rate. These indicators typically have underlying trends or cycles that ARIMA can address through differencing, making the data stationary before applying auto-regressive and moving average components to capture the relationships in the data.\n\nCPIGDP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInitial assessments via ACF and Augmented Dickey-Fuller tests indicated that CPI required differencing due to non-stationarity. After converting to a time series and applying logarithmic transformation, first differencing was insufficient in detrending, but second differencing indicated stationarity.\n\n\n\n\n\nAugmented Dickey-Fuller Test Results:\n\n\nTest Statistic: -0.8219849   P-value: 0.959648\n\n\nThe time series is not stationary based on the ADF test.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter second differencing CPI, ACF shows three lags, while PACF shows four. This suggests ARIMA parameters p = [0,1,2,3], d = [2], q = [0,1,2]. I’ll test these for the lowest AIC, BIC, and AICc, and cross-check with auto.arima to forecasting.\n\n\n   p d q       AIC       BIC      AICc\n1  0 2 0 -7964.774 -7959.951 -7964.769\n2  0 2 1 -8187.294 -8177.650 -8187.281\n3  0 2 2 -8242.219 -8227.752 -8242.193\n4  1 2 0 -8055.798 -8046.154 -8055.785\n5  1 2 1 -8241.533 -8227.066 -8241.507\n6  1 2 2 -8241.209 -8221.920 -8241.165\n7  2 2 0 -8126.439 -8111.973 -8126.413\n8  2 2 1 -8241.021 -8221.732 -8240.977\n9  2 2 2 -8239.420 -8215.309 -8239.354\n10 3 2 0 -8156.962 -8137.673 -8156.918\n11 3 2 1 -8239.300 -8215.189 -8239.234\n12 3 2 2 -8246.314 -8217.381 -8246.222\n\n\nModel fitting with minimum AIC:\n 3, 2, 2, -8246.31447088773, -8217.381286544, -8246.2222645211\n\nModel fitting with minimum AICc:\n 3, 2, 2, -8246.31447088773, -8217.381286544, -8246.2222645211\n\nModel fitting with minimum BIC:\n 0, 2, 2, -8242.21881165827, -8227.75221948641, -8242.19255345258\n\n\nSeries: ts \nARIMA(1,2,1)(2,0,0)[12] \n\nCoefficients:\n         ar1      ma1     sar1     sar2\n      0.2957  -0.8775  -0.2088  -0.1736\ns.e.  0.0413   0.0217   0.0347   0.0362\n\nsigma^2 = 6.977e-06:  log likelihood = 4149.36\nAIC=-8288.72   AICc=-8288.66   BIC=-8264.61\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ARIMA(3,2,2) model exhibits a satisfactory fit, evident from the patternless residuals and lack of autocorrelation, but its coefficients are not all statistically significant. In contrast, the ARIMA(0,2,2) model, while equally displaying white noise residuals and minimal autocorrelation, boasts statistically significant coefficients, lending greater weight to its predictive accuracy. The SARIMA(1,2,1)(2,0,0)[12] also presents a strong fit, confirmed by its residuals and significant p-values, and it outperforms the ARIMA(0,2,2) model in terms of lower AIC, BIC, and AICc values. Nonetheless, the simpler ARIMA(0,2,2) is preferred due to its adequate fit and less complexity. Both models are considered robust, with the choice between them hinging on the trade-off between simplicity and statistical thoroughness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**************************************************************************\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**************************************************************************\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**************************************************************************\n\n\nARIMA(3,2,2):\n\ninitial

projections. The black line represents the actual historical log(CPI) values, showing a general upward trend over time, which indicates that the CPI has been increasing. The blue shaded area starting around 2020 represents the forecasted values, with the shade indicating the confidence interval of the predictions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ARIMA model forecasts (red line) are closest to the actual data, indicating a superior fit among the methods. Accuracy metrics support this, with ARIMA showing the lowest error rates across the board, suggesting high precision and minimal bias in forecasting. Other models like the Mean, Naive, and Seasonal Naive exhibit higher errors, indicating less accurate predictions. The Drift model performs better than these but is still outclassed by ARIMA. Overall, ARIMA is identified as the best model for forecasting CPI in this case.\n\n\nARIMA Model Accuracy Metrics:\n\n\n                        ME      RMSE         MAE           MPE       MAPE\nTraining set -2.196212e-05 0.0027077 0.001861392 -0.0006268637 0.04498296\n                  MASE         ACF1\nTraining set 0.0528366 0.0009203494\n\n\n\nMean Model Accuracy Metrics:\n\n\n                        ME      RMSE       MAE       MPE     MAPE     MASE\nTraining set -9.418417e-18 0.8627205 0.7913189 -4.129501 19.08201 22.46201\n                  ACF1\nTraining set 0.9974046\n\n\n\nNaive Model Accuracy Metrics:\n\n\n                      ME        RMSE         MAE        MPE       MAPE     MASE\nTraining set 0.002891558 0.004483797 0.003403071 0.06783973 0.08035247 0.096598\n                  ACF1\nTraining set 0.5749759\n\n\n\nSeasonal Naive Model Accuracy Metrics:\n\n\n                     ME       RMSE        MAE       MPE      MAPE MASE\nTraining set 0.03439707 0.04412258 0.03522921 0.7988339 0.8224095    1\n                  ACF1\nTraining set 0.9848684\n\n\n\nRandom Walk with Drift Model Accuracy Metrics:\n\n\n                       ME        RMSE         MAE          MPE       MAPE\nTraining set 1.391738e-16 0.003426854 0.002408751 0.0001517385 0.05821684\n                  MASE      ACF1\nTraining set 0.0683737 0.5749759\n\n\n\nModel with the best Accuracy Metrics:\n ARIMA ARIMA ARIMA Mean ARIMA ARIMA ARIMA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInitial assessments via ACF and Augmented Dickey-Fuller tests indicated that GDP required differencing due to non-stationarity.

The residuals suggest the model captures the data’s underlying process well. The second model, which appears to be a SARIMA given the seasonal components, is more complex and doesn’t offer a significantly better fit, as the information criteria scores are marginally higher and some coefficients are not statistically significant. The first model is preferable for its simplicity and performance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**************************************************************************\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**************************************************************************\n\n\nARIMA(1,1,1):\n\ninitial  value -4.489124 \niter   2 value -4.494637\niter   3 value -4.497303\niter   4 value -4.497428\niter   5 value -4.499701\niter   6 value -4.500276\niter   7 value -4.500679\niter   8 value -4.500764\niter   9 value -4.500774\niter  10 value -4.500792\niter  11 value -4.500792\niter  12 value -4.500792\niter  13 value -4.500793\niter  14 value -4.500793\niter  14 value -4.500793\niter  14 value -4.500793\nfinal  value -4.500793 \nconverged\ninitial  value -4.500762 \niter   2 value -4.500768\niter   3 value -4.500777\niter   4 value -4.500778\niter   5 value -4.500778\niter   6 value -4.500780\niter   7 value -4.500781\niter   8 value -4.500781\niter   8 value -4.500781\nfinal  value -4.500781 \nconverged\n$fit\n\nCall:\narima(x = xdata, order = c(p, d, q), seasonal = list(order = c(P, D, Q), period = S), \n    xreg = constant, transform.pars = trans, fixed = fixed, optim.control = list(trace = trc, \n        REPORT = 1, reltol = tol))\n\nCoefficients:\n         ar1      ma1  constant\n      0.4412  -0.3052    0.0076\ns.e.  0.2101   0.2191    0.0008\n\nsigma^2 estimated as 0.0001232:  log likelihood = 939.96,  aic = -1871.92\n\n$degrees_of_freedom\n[1] 302\n\n$ttable\n         Estimate     SE t.value p.value\nar1        0.4412 0.2101  2.1002  0.0365\nma1       -0.3052 0.2191 -1.3930  0.1646\nconstant   0.0076 0.0008  9.6004  0.0000\n\n$AIC\n[1] -6.137455\n\n$AICc\n[1] -6.137194\n\n$BIC\n[1] -6.088664\n\n\n\n**************************************************************************\n\n\nauto.arima (0,2,3)(1,0,1)[4]:\n\ninitial  value -4.209452 \niter   2 value -4.384929\niter   3 value -4.442731\niter   4 value -4.485373\niter   5 value -4.486556\niter   6 value -4.489059\niter   7 value -4.490679\niter   8 value -4.493028\niter   9 value -4.494280\niter  10 value -4.496736\niter  11 value -4.497414\niter  12 value -4.501068\niter  13 value -4.501074\niter  14 value -4.501481\niter  15 value -4.501831\niter  16 value -4.502053\niter  17 value -4.502333\niter  18 value -4.502676\niter  19 value -4.502758\niter  20 value -4.502770\niter  21 value -4.502770\niter  21 value -4.502770\niter  21 value -4.502770\nfinal  value -4.502770 \nconverged\ninitial  value -4.497003 \niter   2 value -4.497051\niter   3 value -4.497159\niter   4 value -4.497198\niter   5 value -4.497207\niter   6 value -4.497209\niter   6 value -4.497209\niter   6 value -4.497209\nfinal  value -4.497209 \nconverged\n$fit\n\nCall:\narima(x = xdata, order = c(p, d, q), seasonal = list(order = c(P, D, Q), period = S), \n    include.mean = !no.constant, transform.pars = trans, fixed = fixed, optim.control = list(trace = trc, \n        REPORT = 1, reltol = tol))\n\nCoefficients:\n          ma1      ma2      ma3     sar1    sma1\n      -0.8748  -0.0010  -0.1093  -0.6082  0.5539\ns.e.   0.0572   0.0756   0.0562   0.3597  0.3727\n\nsigma^2 estimated as 0.0001227:  log likelihood = 935.79,  aic = -1859.59\n\n$degrees_of_freedom\n[1] 299\n\n$ttable\n     Estimate     SE  t.value p.value\nma1   -0.8748 0.0572 -15.2823  0.0000\nma2   -0.0010 0.0756  -0.0137  0.9891\nma3   -0.1093 0.0562  -1.9463  0.0526\nsar1  -0.6082 0.3597  -1.6908  0.0919\nsma1   0.5539 0.3727   1.4861  0.1383\n\n$AIC\n[1] -6.117068\n\n$AICc\n[1] -6.116405\n\n$BIC\n[1] -6.043705\n\n\n\n**************************************************************************\n\n\n\n\nSeries: ts \nARIMA(1,1,1) \n\nCoefficients:\n         ar1      ma1\n      0.9997  -0.9836\ns.e.  0.0006   0.0103\n\nsigma^2 = 0.0001276:  log likelihood = 934.67\nAIC=-1863.34   AICc=-1863.26   BIC=-1852.18\n\nTraining set error measures:\n                        ME       RMSE         MAE          MPE       MAPE\nTraining set -0.0001737751 0.01123841 0.007111044 -0.001027974 0.08112324\n                  MASE      ACF1\nTraining set 0.2069521 0.1241003\n\n\n\nEquation for ARIMA(1,1,1):\n\\[(1 - \\phi B)(1 - B)X_t = (1 + \\theta B)W_t\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nThe forecast shows a projected increase in the log-transformed GDP, with historical data indicating a good model fit.

The Mean Model performs the worst, with the highest errors. The Naive and Seasonal Naive models also show higher errors than ARIMA but are better than the Mean Model. The Random Walk with Drift Model has metrics comparable to the ARIMA model, suggesting it is also a good fit for the data.

    "text": "I choose the ARIMA model for forecasting economic indicators because it’s useful for forecasting a series where the data points are independent of the seasonal components, which is the case with the economic indicators such as CPI, GDP, USD index, unemployment rate, and mortgage rate. These indicators typically have underlying trends or cycles that ARIMA can address through differencing, making the data stationary before applying auto-regressive and moving average components to capture the relationships in the data.\n\nCPIGDP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInitial assessments via ACF and Augmented Dickey-Fuller tests indicated that CPI required differencing due to non-stationarity. After converting to a time series and applying logarithmic transformation, first differencing was insufficient in detrending, but second differencing indicated stationarity.\n\n\n\n\n\nAugmented Dickey-Fuller Test Results:\n\n\nTest Statistic: -0.8219849   P-value: 0.959648\n\n\nThe time series is not stationary based on the ADF test.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter second differencing CPI, ACF shows three lags, while PACF shows four. This suggests ARIMA parameters p = [0,1,2,3], d = [2], q = [0,1,2]. I’ll test these for the lowest AIC, BIC, and AICc, and cross-check with auto.arima to forecasting.\n\n\n   p d q       AIC       BIC      AICc\n1  0 2 0 -7964.774 -7959.951 -7964.769\n2  0 2 1 -8187.294 -8177.650 -8187.281\n3  0 2 2 -8242.219 -8227.752 -8242.193\n4  1 2 0 -8055.798 -8046.154 -8055.785\n5  1 2 1 -8241.533 -8227.066 -8241.507\n6  1 2 2 -8241.209 -8221.920 -8241.165\n7  2 2 0 -8126.439 -8111.973 -8126.413\n8  2 2 1 -8241.021 -8221.732 -8240.977\n9  2 2 2 -8239.420 -8215.309 -8239.354\n10 3 2 0 -8156.962 -8137.673 -8156.918\n11 3 2 1 -8239.300 -8215.189 -8239.234\n12 3 2 2 -8246.314 -8217.381 -8246.222\n\n\nModel fitting with minimum AIC:\n 3, 2, 2, -8246.31447088773, -8217.381286544, -8246.2222645211\n\nModel fitting with minimum AICc:\n 3, 2, 2, -8246.31447088773, -8217.381286544, -8246.2222645211\n\nModel fitting with minimum BIC:\n 0, 2, 2, -8242.21881165827, -8227.75221948641, -8242.19255345258\n\n\nSeries: ts \nARIMA(1,2,1)(2,0,0)[12] \n\nCoefficients:\n         ar1      ma1     sar1     sar2\n      0.2957  -0.8775  -0.2088  -0.1736\ns.e.  0.0413   0.0217   0.0347   0.0362\n\nsigma^2 = 6.977e-06:  log likelihood = 4149.36\nAIC=-8288.72   AICc=-8288.66   BIC=-8264.61\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ARIMA(3,2,2) model exhibits a satisfactory fit, evident from the patternless residuals and lack of autocorrelation, but its coefficients are not all statistically significant. In contrast, the ARIMA(0,2,2) model, while equally displaying white noise residuals and minimal autocorrelation, boasts statistically significant coefficients, lending greater weight to its predictive accuracy. The SARIMA(1,2,1)(2,0,0)[12] also presents a strong fit, confirmed by its residuals and significant p-values, and it outperforms the ARIMA(0,2,2) model in terms of lower AIC, BIC, and AICc values. Nonetheless, the simpler ARIMA(0,2,2) is preferred due to its adequate fit and less complexity. Both models are considered robust, with the choice between them hinging on the trade-off between simplicity and statistical thoroughness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**************************************************************************\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**************************************************************************\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**************************************************************************\n\n\nARIMA(3,2,2):\n\ninitial

projections. The black line represents the actual historical log(CPI) values, showing a general upward trend over time, which indicates that the CPI has been increasing.

Accuracy metrics support this, with ARIMA showing the lowest error rates across the board, suggesting high precision and minimal bias in forecasting. Other models like the Mean, Naive, and Seasonal Naive exhibit higher errors, indicating less accurate predictions. The Drift model performs better than these but is still outclassed by ARIMA.

    "text": "SARIMA - Treasury Security\nSARIMA models are used for treasury yields like 3-month T-bills or 20-year T-bonds because they help predict the regular ups and downs that happen throughout the year. These ups and downs can be due to when the government borrows more, changes in how often people invest, and rules that banks follow at certain times. SARIMA can catch these patterns, making it easier to guess where yields will go next, which is very important for people who invest in these securities.\n\n3 Month Treasury Bill6 Month Treasury Bill\n\n\n\nData Processing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStationarity Check\n\nInitial assessments via ACF and Augmented Dickey-Fuller tests indicated that 3Mon T-Bill Yield required differencing due to non-stationarity. After converting to a time series, first differencing and seasonal differencing alone were insufficient in detrending, but the combination of non-seasonal and seaonal differencing indicated strong stationarity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAugmented Dickey-Fuller Test Results:\n\n\nTest Statistic: -3.318366   P-value: 0.07045011\n\n\nThe time series is not stationary based on the ADF test.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModel Fitting\n\nAfter second differencing 3 Month T-Bill Yield, ACF shows three lags, while PACF shows four.

The MA10 closely follows the CPI’s short-term fluctuations, while the MA50 and MA100 smooth out these variations, lagging behind and highlighting the broader trend. The recent steep climb in the CPI suggests an acceleration in inflation not yet fully captured by the moving averages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe chart illustrates the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and its associated moving averages (MA10, MA50, MA100), all ascending, which signifies sustained economic growth. The MA10 is tracking the GDP’s immediate shifts, reflecting the economy’s short-term variations, whereas the MA50 and MA100 provide a more subdued perspective, trailing behind and emphasizing the long-term economic trend. The noticeable upward trajectory in the most recent GDP data points to a potential surge in economic activity, a detail that the longer-term moving averages have yet to fully incorporate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe chart shows the US Dollar Index with its moving averages (MA10, MA50, MA100), reflecting a volatile currency market. Short-term fluctuations are closely followed by MA10, while MA50 and MA100 smooth out these fluctuations to reveal more sustained trends. A notable peak and subsequent decline around 2020 are followed by a recovery, with recent trends suggesting an increase in the dollar’s value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe graph shows the trend of 30-year mortgage rates from around 1980 to 2020, with a clear peak in the early 1980s. It includes the actual rates and three moving averages (50-day, 100-day, and 500-day), which smooth out short-term fluctuations. Over time, there’s a notable decline in mortgage rates, with all the lines converging, indicating stabilization of rates towards 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe graph displays the historical trends of the unemployment rate from the 1960s to around 2020, including actual rates and their moving averages over 10, 50, and 100 periods. The chart shows several spikes indicating periods of increased unemployment, with the most significant peaks likely corresponding to economic recessions. Notably, there is an extreme spike in unemployment at the end of the timeline, suggesting a sudden, sharp increase in unemployment, possibly caused by the Coronavirus pandamic."

In an era of global interconnectivity, even minute actions by central banks can reverberate across distant economies. Therefore, it is imperative to examine their roles, tools, and execution. Well-known central banks include The Federal Reserve System (the Fed), the Bank of England, the European Central Bank (ECB).\n\n\nInterest Rate\nInterest rates are central banks’ potent tools that play a significant role in the domestic and global economy. As depicted in the flow chart, when interest rates are raised, it leads to a short-term reduction in consumption, investment, government spending, and net exports, resulting in GDP contraction. However, in the long term, it tends to curb inflation. Conversely, when interest rates are lowered, the opposite effect occurs, stimulating economic activity. This illustrates how central banks manipulate interest rates to influence economic conditions.\n\n\nFed Funds Rate\nThe Fed Funds Rate, set by the U.S. Federal Reserve, is the rate at which banks lend to each other overnight and significantly influences other interest rates in the economy, including those of Treasury securities. When the Fed changes this rate, it impacts borrowing costs, affecting spending and investment throughout the economy. This shift alters demand for Treasury securities, changing their yields and subsequently influencing the shape of the Treasury Yield Curve, which is viewed as an indicator of future economic conditions. In essence, the Fed Funds Rate indirectly sways the Treasury securities market and the broader economic outlook through its influence on borrowing costs and investment.\n\nLink\n\n\nGross Domestic Product\nGDP = Consumption + Investment + Government Spending + Net Exports\nThe Federal Reserve’s adjustments to the Federal Funds Rate, the interest rate at which banks lend to each other overnight, wield significant influence over the broader economy. When the Fed raises this rate, borrowing costs throughout the economy tend to rise, often dampening spending and investment and subsequently slowing economic growth, while potentially curbing inflation. Conversely, when the Fed lowers the rate, borrowing generally becomes less costly, encouraging spending and investment, potentially boosting economic growth but also risking heightened inflation. Therefore, the Fed’s policy decisions on the Federal Funds Rate carefully navigate between stimulating economic activity and maintaining control over inflation.\n\n\nRisk-Free Rate\nThe risk-free rate refers to the expected return of an investment that bears no risk, unaffected by factors like inflation. Widely recognized benchmarks, such as the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and the U.S. Treasury Bond Yield Curve, are often associated with this rate due to their strong economic backing and perceived low-risk nature.\n\n\nU.S. Treasury Securities\nU.S. Treasury securities, encompassing Treasury Bills (T-Bills), Treasury Bonds, and Treasury Notes, are pivotal financial instruments utilized by the federal government for capital-raising to fund its obligations. T-Bills, with maturities ranging from four to fifty-two weeks, are sold at a discount and are considered ultra short-term; Treasury Bonds have a much longer maturity of up to thirty years, and Treasury Notes feature mid-range maturities between two and ten years. Both bonds and notes pay semi-annual interest. Backed by the U.S. government’s credit, these securities are deemed low-risk, making them appealing to investors seeking capital preservation, especially in economically uncertain times. T-Bills, often utilized as a benchmark in financial markets, hold particular significance due to their inherent stability and impact on various economic metrics and monetary policy.\n\n\nTreasury Yield Curve\nThe Treasury Yield Curve is a graph that shows the interest rates of U.S. government bonds and how they change for different time periods. Imagine a line that usually goes up, meaning investors get higher interest if they agree to lend money for a longer time. This line can provide hints about future economic conditions. If the line flips and goes down, meaning short-term interest rates are higher than long-term ones, it might suggest economic trouble ahead. People watch this curve because it helps them guess what might happen with interest rates and the economy in the future.\n\nLink\n\n\nSummary\nThe interest rate serves as a pivotal tool in the Federal Reserve’s arsenal for regulating economic conditions. A key concept within this realm is the risk-free rate, which denotes an interest rate shielded from external risks and exposures. Typically, market participants turn to benchmarks such as LIBOR or the Treasury Bill (T-Bill) interest rate when seeking a risk-free rate, primarily due to their inherently low risk profile. Notably, the T-Bill rate is not a fixed figure prescribed by the Treasury Department; instead, it fluctuates in accordance with the prices of various T-Bills traded on the secondary market.\nHowever, a common query arises: If the market determines the risk-free rate, why do people frequently attribute changes in interest rates to actions taken by the Federal Reserve? The answer lies in the Federal Reserve’s influence over the overnight interest rate, known as the Fed Funds Rate. This rate plays a significant role in the yield curve, particularly when examining the curve at a very short-term horizon (i.e., when x equals 0.0001). Consequently, when individuals refer to the Federal Reserve raising or lowering interest rates, they are typically alluding to the central bank’s actions pertaining to the Fed Funds Rate.\nThis project is inspried by the work of Harvard Law Review “FEDERAL RESERVE — U.S. MONETARY POLICY SHOWS THE MAJOR ISSUES WITH THE MAJOR QUESTIONS DOCTRINE. — Federal Reserve Interest Rate Hike on March 22, 2023.”\nHarvard Law Review (2023)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nHarvard Law Review. 2023. “Federal Reserve Interest Rate Hike on March 22, 2023” 136 (7): 2028–35."
