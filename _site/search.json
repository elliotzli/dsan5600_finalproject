    "text": "The Treasury yield minus the Federal Funds Rate essentially reflects the spread or differential between the two, which can signal several economic conditions and expectations.\n\nMonetary Policy and Economic Cycles Insight:\n\nInterest Rate Expectations: A larger spread between Treasury yields and the Federal Funds Rate could indicate that investors expect interest rates to rise in the future, possibly due to economic growth or inflation expectations.\nEconomic Health: A narrowing spread might suggest that investors are seeking safe-haven assets, which could imply economic uncertainty or an impending recession.\n\nRisk and Investment Dynamics:\n\nRisk Sentiment: A widening spread might indicate a risk-on environment where investors are favoring higher-yielding assets, whereas a narrowing spread might suggest risk-aversion.\nInvestment Strategy: Differentials in Treasury yields can influence asset allocation and investment strategies, particularly in fixed-income portfolios.\n\nInternational Capital Flows:\n\nAttractiveness to Foreign Investors: Larger spreads between U.S. Treasury yields and the Federal Funds Rate compared to foreign bond yields might attract international capital, influencing currency value and global fund flows.\nGlobal Comparative Advantage: Evaluate how the spreads compare with the interest rate differentials of other countries, which might impact international investment decisions.\n\nInflation and Real Yield Perspectives:\n\nInflation Expectations: Higher Treasury yields (relative to the Federal Funds Rate) might be associated with higher future inflation expectations, as investors might demand higher nominal yields.\nReal Yields: Analyzing these spreads alongside inflation metrics allows for evaluating real yield dynamics and their implications for savers and investors.\n\nFiscal and Monetary Policy Interactions: i)Policy Efficiency: Understanding how fiscal policies (like government borrowing, reflected in Treasury yields) interact with monetary policy (indicated by the Federal Funds Rate) can provide insights into the overall policy environment and effectiveness.\n\nHarper (2023)\n\n\nCode\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\nimport plotly.io as pio\nimport pandas as pd\nimport warnings\n\nwarnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\")\npio.renderers.default = \"plotly_mimetype+notebook_connected\"\ndf = pd.read_excel('data/data/sr_t-bill-rates.xlsx')\ndf.ffill(inplace=True)\nfig = go.Figure()\nfor col in df.columns[1:]:\n    fig.add_trace(go.Scatter(x=df['observation_date'], y=df[col], name=col, visible=True, line=dict(width=1)))\nbuttons = [\n    dict(label='All',\n         method='update',\n         args=[{'visible': [True for col in df.columns[1:]]}]),\n    dict(label='None',\n         method='update',\n         args=[{'visible': [False for col in df.columns[1:]]}])\n]\nfor col in df.columns[1:]:\n    buttons.append(\n        dict(label=col,\n             method='update',\n             args=[{'visible': [True if c == col else False for c in df.columns[1:]]}])\n    )\nfig.update_layout(\n    updatemenus=[\n        dict(\n            buttons=buttons,\n            direction=\"down\",\n            active=0,\n            x=1.13,\n            y=0.68,\n        ),\n    ],\n    xaxis=dict(\n        rangeslider=dict(visible=True),\n        type=\"date\"\n    ),\n    title_text=\"Treasury Bill Constant Maturity Minus Federal Funds Rate &lt;br&gt;&lt;sup&gt;reflect the difference between various Treasury Bill yields and the Federal Funds Rate&lt;/sup&gt; \",\n    xaxis_title=\"Date\",\n    yaxis_title=\"Treasury Yield Rates\",\n    width=900,\n    height=600,  \n    margin=dict(t=100),\n    plot_bgcolor='white',\n    yaxis_range=[-6,5]\n)\nfig.update_xaxes(gridcolor='lightgrey', griddash='dot')\nfig.update_yaxes(gridcolor='lightgrey', griddash='dot')\n\nnote = 'Source:&lt;a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/\"\"&gt;Federal Reserve Economic Data&lt;/a&gt;'\nfig.add_annotation(\n    showarrow=False,\n    text=note,\n    font=dict(size=10), \n    xref='x domain',\n    x=1.1,\n    yref='y domain',\n    y=-0.5\n    )\nfig.show()\n\n\n\n                                                \n\n\n\nT3MFF: 3-Month Treasury Constant Maturity Minus Federal Funds Rate\nT6MFF: 6-Month Treasury Constant Maturity Minus Federal Funds Rate\nT1YFF: 1-Year Treasury Constant Maturity Minus Federal Funds Rate\n\n The graph clearly shows a strong link between the 3-month, 6-month, and 1-year Treasury bill yield differences. Simply, the 3-month bill has the lowest rate, the 6-month bill is in the middle, and the 1-year bill shows the highest rate difference.\nLooking at the timeline, there’s a noticeable bumpy ride from 1982 to 2000. When financial crises hit, like the Asian Financial Crisis in 1997, the Global Financial Crisis in 2008, and the onset of Covid-19 in 2020, the gap between the Treasury bill yields and the Federal Funds Rate (FFR) turns negative. This means the bill’s yield is lower than the FFR. When the gap is positive, the situation reverses. Here’s why this happens:\n\nInvestor Sentiment: In shaky economic times, investors often buy safe assets like Treasury bills, which raises their price but lowers their yield.\nMonetary Policy: If the FFR is higher than T-Bill rates, it might point to the Federal Reserve using a tight monetary policy.\nEconomic Signs: In the past, when short-term rates dip below long-term rates or when the Treasury yield is less than the FFR, it has sometimes signaled a coming recession.\nGlobal Investment: During global economic ups and downs, investors from other countries might invest in US Treasury bills even if the yields are low."

Simply, the 3-month bill has the lowest rate, the 6-month bill is in the middle, and the 1-year bill shows the highest rate difference.\nLooking at the timeline, there’s a noticeable bumpy ride from 1982 to 2000. When financial crises hit, like the Asian Financial Crisis in 1997, the Global Financial Crisis in 2008, and the onset of Covid-19 in 2020, the gap between the Treasury bill yields and the Federal Funds Rate (FFR) turns negative. This means the bill’s yield is lower than the FFR. When the gap is positive, the situation reverses. Here’s why this happens:\n\nInvestor Sentiment: In shaky economic times, investors often buy safe assets like Treasury bills, which raises their price but lowers their yield.\nMonetary Policy: If the FFR is higher than T-Bill rates, it might point to the Federal Reserve using a tight monetary policy.\nEconomic Signs: In the past, when short-term rates dip below long-term rates or when the Treasury yield is less than the FFR, it has sometimes signaled a coming recession.\nGlobal Investment: During global economic ups and downs, investors from other countries might invest in US Treasury bills even if the yields are low."

In an era of global interconnectivity, even minute actions by central banks can reverberate across distant economies. Therefore, it is imperative to examine their roles, tools, and execution. Well-known central banks include The Federal Reserve System (the Fed), the Bank of England, the European Central Bank (ECB).\n\n\nInterest Rate\nInterest rates are central banks’ potent tools that play a significant role in the domestic and global economy. As depicted in the flow chart, when interest rates are raised, it leads to a short-term reduction in consumption, investment, government spending, and net exports, resulting in GDP contraction. However, in the long term, it tends to curb inflation. Conversely, when interest rates are lowered, the opposite effect occurs, stimulating economic activity. This illustrates how central banks manipulate interest rates to influence economic conditions.\n\n\nFed Funds Rate\nThe Fed Funds Rate, set by the U.S. Federal Reserve, is the rate at which banks lend to each other overnight and significantly influences other interest rates in the economy, including those of Treasury securities. When the Fed changes this rate, it impacts borrowing costs, affecting spending and investment throughout the economy. This shift alters demand for Treasury securities, changing their yields and subsequently influencing the shape of the Treasury Yield Curve, which is viewed as an indicator of future economic conditions. In essence, the Fed Funds Rate indirectly sways the Treasury securities market and the broader economic outlook through its influence on borrowing costs and investment.\n\nLink\n\n\nGross Domestic Product\nGDP = Consumption + Investment + Government Spending + Net Exports\nThe Federal Reserve’s adjustments to the Federal Funds Rate, the interest rate at which banks lend to each other overnight, wield significant influence over the broader economy. When the Fed raises this rate, borrowing costs throughout the economy tend to rise, often dampening spending and investment and subsequently slowing economic growth, while potentially curbing inflation. Conversely, when the Fed lowers the rate, borrowing generally becomes less costly, encouraging spending and investment, potentially boosting economic growth but also risking heightened inflation. Therefore, the Fed’s policy decisions on the Federal Funds Rate carefully navigate between stimulating economic activity and maintaining control over inflation.\n\n\nRisk-Free Rate\nThe risk-free rate refers to the expected return of an investment that bears no risk, unaffected by factors like inflation. Widely recognized benchmarks, such as the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and the U.S. Treasury Bond Yield Curve, are often associated with this rate due to their strong economic backing and perceived low-risk nature.\n\n\nU.S. Treasury Securities\nU.S. Treasury securities, encompassing Treasury Bills (T-Bills), Treasury Bonds, and Treasury Notes, are pivotal financial instruments utilized by the federal government for capital-raising to fund its obligations. T-Bills, with maturities ranging from four to fifty-two weeks, are sold at a discount and are considered ultra short-term; Treasury Bonds have a much longer maturity of up to thirty years, and Treasury Notes feature mid-range maturities between two and ten years. Both bonds and notes pay semi-annual interest. Backed by the U.S. government’s credit, these securities are deemed low-risk, making them appealing to investors seeking capital preservation, especially in economically uncertain times. T-Bills, often utilized as a benchmark in financial markets, hold particular significance due to their inherent stability and impact on various economic metrics and monetary policy.\n\n\nTreasury Yield Curve\nThe Treasury Yield Curve is a graph that shows the interest rates of U.S. government bonds and how they change for different time periods. Imagine a line that usually goes up, meaning investors get higher interest if they agree to lend money for a longer time. This line can provide hints about future economic conditions. If the line flips and goes down, meaning short-term interest rates are higher than long-term ones, it might suggest economic trouble ahead. People watch this curve because it helps them guess what might happen with interest rates and the economy in the future.\n\nLink\n\n\nSummary\nThe interest rate serves as a pivotal tool in the Federal Reserve’s arsenal for regulating economic conditions. A key concept within this realm is the risk-free rate, which denotes an interest rate shielded from external risks and exposures. Typically, market participants turn to benchmarks such as LIBOR or the Treasury Bill (T-Bill) interest rate when seeking a risk-free rate, primarily due to their inherently low risk profile. Notably, the T-Bill rate is not a fixed figure prescribed by the Treasury Department; instead, it fluctuates in accordance with the prices of various T-Bills traded on the secondary market.\nHowever, a common query arises: If the market determines the risk-free rate, why do people frequently attribute changes in interest rates to actions taken by the Federal Reserve? The answer lies in the Federal Reserve’s influence over the overnight interest rate, known as the Fed Funds Rate. This rate plays a significant role in the yield curve, particularly when examining the curve at a very short-term horizon (i.e., when x equals 0.0001). Consequently, when individuals refer to the Federal Reserve raising or lowering interest rates, they are typically alluding to the central bank’s actions pertaining to the Fed Funds Rate.\nThis project is inspried by the work of Harvard Law Review “FEDERAL RESERVE — U.S. MONETARY POLICY SHOWS THE MAJOR ISSUES WITH THE MAJOR QUESTIONS DOCTRINE. — Federal Reserve Interest Rate Hike on March 22, 2023.”\nHarvard Law Review (2023)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nHarvard Law Review. 2023. “Federal Reserve Interest Rate Hike on March 22, 2023” 136 (7): 2028–35."
